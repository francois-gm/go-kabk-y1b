# A website you like 

*(small presentation assignment)*

## Assignment

Every week, 2 students will present us with a website.

**Think about…**

- How did you end up on that website?
- What makes this website worthy of your presentation?
- Does it look ‘special’, does it look ‘normal’, if so is it a good thing? Why?
- How do you navigate in that website? How do you find your way? What helps you finding your way or not?
- What do you think of the visual elements of the website, how do they contribute to the navigation experience?
- Ultimately, did you get what you ‘wanted’ from that website? Or did it make you think? Or did you learn something? Or was it a positive experience?

**Tell us about (keywords):**

- Appearance
- Movement
- Structure
- Navigation
- Functionality (does it do what it should)
- Accessibility

Duration of the presentation: **around 2 minutes** per person.
