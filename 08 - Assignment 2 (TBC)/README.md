## A web intervention: develop a browser extension

In the past weeks, we have touched upon HTML and CSS, learning how to place basic HTML content elements and style them. For this assignment, we will combine what we’ve learned with a new programming language, JavaScript, and will create an intervention on existing web pages.

### What is a browser (web) extension?

A browser extension is a piece of code that is read by your browser on **top** of a current webpage. Extensions can add functionality, manipulate, style differently, or obfuscate elements of an already existing webpage (or all webpages).

One of the most famous examples is the “Ad blocker”. An “ad blocker” is a piece of script and CSS that checks for various elements in the page that appear as advertisement (via the use of specific ids, classes, or functions on them) and makes them “dissapear” either via scripts and/or CSS. A very primitive example of this would be a JavaScript function that adds the CSS “display:none;” property to all html elements that have an attribute with the word “ad” in it.

But of course there are other examples.
