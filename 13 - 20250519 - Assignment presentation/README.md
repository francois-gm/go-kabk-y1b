# Class 13, 2025/12/19

## Intro (20min)

- A website you like (Yicheng, Eva)

## *Web intervention*, each present their final project (2h)

### a) Put your web extension online (30min)

1) Create an account on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com).
2) `Site` -> `Deploy manually` (`browse to upload`).
3) When browsing, select your *project* folder (`my-project-template`, as an example), by this I mean the **root** folder of the (presentation) webpage of your web extension, that contains your `index.html`, your `assets` and your `content` folders.
4) There it is!

Add your url to the list (you can change the URL to a name you want to keep for later)

### b) Presentation

#### 1) Peer reviews (1h)

- You will have to collectively review twelve (12) other student's projects (!) For this we will use EtherPad, which allows to collaboratively (and anonymously) edit text in real time. 

For each project (except yours): write **two sentences** that summarizes the project. First take **one minute** to review the presentation page, download and install the extension, then **one minute** to review the extension itself, **one minute** to **write** your two sentences, and **one last minute** to review your sentences, and edit / wrap up your formulation. The two sentences shall have the form of an 'appraisal'. Please highlight positive points as well as bring a point of critique if that is relevant.

**What is critique?** *Not* equal to criticism. Critique more as the *faculty* of judging (a method of disciplined, systematic study).

Points you can include in your sentence:

- What it does?
- What works well?
- What could work better?
- What is the overall experience?


Write your sentences in [add URL address of the writing pad]

Then read out these three sentences.
