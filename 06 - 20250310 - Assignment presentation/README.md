## Intro (15min)

- A website you like (Simone, Iloy, Julia (F), François)

## An *Ode to CSS*, each present their final project (1h45)

### a) Put your website online (30min)

1) Create an account on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com).
2) `Site` -> `Deploy manually` (`browse to upload`).
3) When browsing, select your *project* folder (`my-project-template`, as an example), by this I mean the **root** folder of your project, that contains your `index.html`, your `assets` and your `content` folders.
4) There it is!

Add your url to the list.

### b) Presentation (1h15)

- You have **two minutes** to present the website of one of your classmate (so not your website).
- First, do a *test drive* of the website. *Click, resize, scroll*…
- **How does the website works?** Functionality? Aesthetics? Conceptual? **Describe it in a few sentences**.

Then:

- **Guess the CSS property** (class can help if not easy to guess, too).
- What does this project make you think of?
- Give a **positive quality** / something you **appreciate** in the website, and tell us **why**.
- Think of the challenges / difficulties of working with this CSS property? How was this addressed?
- If you would have to work on this website, are there elements you could either fine-tune or push further? Think functional, aesthetical, conceptual.
