# Class 14, 2024/12/09

## Intro (20min)

- A website you like (Olya, Amy, Isaac, FranÃ§ois)

## *Poetic function*, each present their final project (2h)

### a) Put your website online (30min)

1) Create an account on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com).
2) `Site` -> `Deploy manually` (`browse to upload`).
3) When browsing, select your *project* folder (`my-project-template`, as an example), by this I mean the **root** folder of your project, that contains your `index.html`, your `assets` and your `content` folders.
4) There it is!

Add your url to the list.

Also add the *house* workshop url to the list following the same procedure.

### b) Presentation

#### 1) Peer reviews (1h)

- You will have to collectively review every student's projects (!) For this we will use EtherPad, which allows to collaboratively (and anonymously) edit text in real time. 

For each project (except yours): write **one sentence** that summarizes the project. First take **one minute** to **navigate the project**, and **one minute** to **write** that sentence. The sentence shall have the form of an 'appraisal'. Please highlight positive points as well as bring a point of critique if that is relevant.

**What is critique?** *Not* equal to criticism. Critique more as the *faculty* of judging (a method of disciplined, systematic study).

Points you can include in your sentence:

- What it does?
- What works well?
- What could work better?
- What is the overall experience?

Write your sentences in [this writing pad](https://pad.xpub.nl/p/Y1A_peer_reviews).

#### 2) Showcasing your website (45min)

First, look at the list. Pick up **two** sentences that you think summarize the best your project.

You will present your website to the class. Show how it works.

Then read out these three sentences.
