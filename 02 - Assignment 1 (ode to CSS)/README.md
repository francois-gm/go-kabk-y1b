# An ode to CSS (assignment 1)

## Presentation

- Make a page that 'celebrates' a CSS property (an *ode*, a *homage*...)
- In the format of an HTML page that uses your assigned CSS property
- The page should be a work in itself, so don't be scared to get "conceptual" or "abstract"
- But(!), you need to stay true to the property assigned
- Ultimately, each combined pages will form a collection of pages
- You might have to use other CSS properties as well in order to 'highlight' your property.
- During the assignment, you will have time to share your findings on your assigned property, as well as learn about other's findings

Schedule:

- **3 February**: introduction of the assignment
- **10 February**: class presentation of your property (2h)
- **17 February**: individual follow-up on the assignment (4h)
- **3 March**: small group follow-up on the assignment (2h)
- **10 March**: delivery and presentation of the assignment in class
