# An ode to CSS (assignment 1)

## Presentation

- Make a page that 'celebrates' a CSS property (an *ode*, a *homage*...)
- In the format of an HTML page that uses your assigned CSS property
- The page should work as a display of most potential use cases of that property
- Ultimately, each combined pages will form a collection of pages, an 'index' of most properties and their possibilities
- You might have to use other CSS properties as well in order to 'highlight' your property.
- During the assignment, you will have time to share your findings on your assigned property, as well as learn about other's findings
