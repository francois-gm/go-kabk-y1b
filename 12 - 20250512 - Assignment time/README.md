## A website you like (15min)

-

## Template for presentation page (30min)

See file `my-project-template.zip` under that page.

### Prepare your extension for dowload (for others)

- You unfortunately can't use the Chrome 'pack extension' since your code will need to be reviewed by the Chrome team.
- But others can download your extension as a .zip file and install it in the same way that you have been able to install it yourself (enabling the 'developer tools'.

See instructions below (to add to your presentation page) for installation:

**Load an unpacked extension**

1) Click on **Window**, and **Extensions**.
2) Activate the **developer mode** (toggle switch on the top right of the window)
3) Click on the **Load unpacked** button
4) Locate and select the folder of the extension (`my-extension-project`).
