## Tutorial: web extension, filter and modify text with JavaScript (3h30)

- Replace one element of the page with text.
- Replace multiple elements with text (using a `forEach` loop).
- Looping a replace function in a `setInterval` (in order to re-apply dynamically the filter).
- Filter several terms with a *word map* and using a `TreeWalker` method (website's *tree* structure) to filter the website's DOM.
