## Tutorial: web extension, filter and modify text with JavaScript (1h)

- Replace one element of the page with text.
- Replace multiple elements with text (using a `forEach` loop).
- Looping a replace function in a `setInterval` (in order to re-apply dynamically the filter).
- Filter several terms with a "Word map" and use a `TreeWalker` method (which refers to the website's *tree* structure) to filter the website's DOM.
